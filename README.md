# advent-of-code-2020

Repository for solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

### Running

Project is already setup with gradle. To run the app:

* Navigate to top-level directory on the command line
* Run `./gradlew run` to run all days
* Run `./gradlew run --args $DAY` where `$DAY` is an integer to run a specific day

### Testing

Project includes Junit and Hamcrest and a stub unit test to get you going. To run all tests:

* Navigate to top-level directory on the command line
* Run `./gradlew test`
* Add `--info`, `--debug` or `--stacktrace` flags for more output

##### Test input

By default, instantiations of `Day` classes in tests will use the input files in `src/test/resources`, _not_ those in `src/main/resources`.
This hopefully gives you flexibility - you could either just copy the real input into `src/test/resources` if you want to test
the actual answers, or you could add a file of test data based on the examples given on the Advent of Code description for the day.
The stub `Day1Test` class shows a test of the functionality of `Day1` where the test input differs from the actual input.
